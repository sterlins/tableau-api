<!-- Add select menu for gender -->

<!-- Add a container where you would like to see the viz appear -->

<!-- Call the Javascript API, this is based on whether you're using PUblic, Server, or Online (and what version) -->

<!-- Instantiate the viz -->

<!-- Now write a function that replaces the filter based on what values are chosen in the 'select' above -->
<!-- We need one statement that has "all" values and one that lets you swap between male and female -->
